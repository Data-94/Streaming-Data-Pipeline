# Streaming-Data-Pipeline
This project builds a real-time data pipeline that ingests live CSV data via Kafka, processes it dynamically with Apache Spark on Dataproc, runs analytical SQL queries on BigQuery, and automates the entire workflow using Apache Airflowâ€”ideal for fast-changing environments like manufacturing and logistics.
